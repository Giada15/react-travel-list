# React Travel List

This is a small React app I built as part of *The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More* on Udemy. The purpose of the project is to practice core React concepts like state, props, components, conditional rendering, and styling.

> âœ… All code is written by me, following along with the course tutorials, for learning purposes.
